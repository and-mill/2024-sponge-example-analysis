# 2024 Sponge Example Analysis
This is the code for the paper [The Impact of Uniform Inputs on Activation Sparsity and Energy-Latency Attacks in Computer Vision](https://github.com/and-mill/2024-sponge-example-analysis).

This script showcases how to use the strategies to generate sponge examples and measure their post-relu density as well as the amount of uniform surfaces.

Possible strategies are:
1. Random Image (Baseline)
2. Uniform Sampling Strategy
3. Natural Sampling (most densely activating image from ImageNet)
4. Sponge-GA Strategy
5. Sponge-LBFGS Strategy

Resulting images will be in the 'results' folder.

# Setup
We used Python 3.9 for this project. Setup with conda:

```
conda create --name sponge_example_analysis python=3.9
conda activate sponge_example_analysis
```

Then install requirements:
```
pip install torch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113 & pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

Then run
```
conda install jupyter 
```
This step is necessary for running Jupyter Notebook successfully on some systems.

# Usage
Use either Jupyter Notebook and run `example.ipynb` or run
```
python example.py
```
They contain the same code.
